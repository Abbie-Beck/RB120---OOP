  =============================
  Main Goal:
  The main objective of this game is to end the game with a hand total that is 
  as close to 21 as possible without going over.
  If either player exceeds 21 points, that player "busts" (loses)
  
  Points per Card:
  - Numbered cards are worth that number of points
  - Jacks, Queens, and Kings are worth 10 points 
  - Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on which is better for that 
    player's hand in light of their other cards (1 if they would bust, 11 otherwise)
  
  Getting Started:
  Players are initially dealt 2 cards from a standard deck of 52 cards
  To start the game, the player (you) will be able to see
    - Your two cards and current total points
    - One of the dealer's cards, (not the other or their total points)
    
  How it Works:
    Player Turn:
      Players may choose to
        - "hit" (draw another card, adding its value to their total)
        or 
        - "stay" (end their turn, their total remains unchanged)
      
      If the player chooses to hit and their points exceed 21, they immediately 
      bust and lose the game
      If they choose to stay, it becomes the dealer's turn
      
    Dealer Turn:
      The dealer has the same set of choices with the same consequences
      If the dealer busts, the player wins!
      Otherwise, the value of both the player and dealer's totals are compared 
      and the one with the highest total points wins.
